        <h2>Aptech Pakistan</h2>
        <p class="at_P">
          APTECH came to Pakistan in 1998, when the concept of vocational
          education in I.T. was only up-to learning of MS Word and Spreadsheets.
          APTECH Computer Education gave exposure to Pakistani youth towards
          global learning in I.T. education. Within the short span of time it
          became the leading I.T. training provider of the country with its
          presence in all the major cities. Since last decade, all of our
          franchise centers are providing Quality Education with international
          standards and an international certificate acceptable and transferable
          worldwide. During this tenure we have served the I.T. Market of
          Pakistan by producing thousands of quality professionals serving at
          key positions of several MNCs, Software Houses, Banks and other Public
          and Private sectors across Pakistan and abroad. Being the global
          organization, APTECH is maintaining global standards at every step
          right from the admission of a student to teaching and training,
          administration to accounts, examination to certification and marketing
          to student placement.

        <br />
        <p class="at_P">
          Web development, also known as website development, refers to the
          tasks associated with creating, building, and maintaining websites and
          web applications that run online on a browser. It may, however, also
          include web design, web programming, and database management.<br />

          <br />
          Web development is closely related to the job of designing the
          features and functionality of apps (web design). The term development
          is usually reserved for the actual construction of these things (that
          is to say, the programming of sites).<br />

          <br />The basic tools involved in web development are programming
          languages called HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading
          Style Sheets), and JavaScript. There are, however, a number of other
          programs used to “manage” or facilitate the construction of sites that
          would otherwise have to be done “from scratch” by writing code. A
          number of content management systems (CMS) fall into this category,
          including WordPress, Joomla!, Drupal, TYPO3, and Adobe Experience
          Manager, among others.

        <h2 id="mobile">Mobile Development</h2>
        <p class="at_P">
          Mobile app development is the process of creating software for mobile
          devices, such as smartphones and tablets. It involves writing code and
          designing the app. The software can be preinstalled on the device,
          downloaded from a mobile app store, or accessed through a mobile web
          browser.

        <p class="at_P">
          Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence of machines and
          software, as opposed to humans and animals. It is a field of study in
          computer science that develops and studies intelligent machines.

          IoT, or the Internet of Things, is a network of devices that can
          exchange data with other devices and systems over the internet. IoT
          devices can include mechanical and digital machines, consumer objects,
          and anything with a sensor that has a unique identifier.

        <h2 id="bolckchain">Blockchain</h2>
        <p class="at_P">
          A blockchain is a digital ledger that is decentralized and
          distributed. It is made up of blocks, which are records that are used
          to record transactions across many computers. This ensures that any
          block involved cannot be altered retroactively without changing all
          subsequent blocks.
